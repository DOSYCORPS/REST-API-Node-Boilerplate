# REST-API-Node-Boilerplate

A simple and customizable RESTful API boilerplate written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as web framework.

The boilerplate is backed with a [Redis](https://redis.io/), a [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) and a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for demo purpose only.


# Requirements

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

# Customization
